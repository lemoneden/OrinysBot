# OrinysBot

## Files
- `bot.py` - the main file with the bot.
- `tests.A json` - database of tests with questions.
- `answers.json` - database of correct test responses.

## Start a bot
- `/start` - start a bot in Telegram.

## PS
- The whole bot is crammed into one poor file. There are many shortcomings.
