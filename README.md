# OrinysBot

## Files
`bot.py` - the main file with the bot.\br
`tests.A json` - database of tests with questions.\br
`answers.json` - database of correct test responses.\br

## Start a bot
/start - start a bot in Telegram.

## PS
- The whole bot is crammed into one poor file. There are many shortcomings.
